# Plan Merging Project

## About
This is a student project at the University of Potsdam which deals with the declarative programming language ASP (Answer Set Programming) and the [asprilo](https://potassco.org/asprilo/) framework by [potassco](https://potassco.org) where robots in a warehouse environment need to fulfill their goals. For simplicity, we are solely focusing on the M-Domain in which it suffices when robots reach the destination of an ordered product in a shelf. 
We aim to find a solution for intelligently merging plans of individual robots into one common plan for all robots to increase performance.

## Directory Structure
- `benchmarks/` contains all of our  M-domain benchmark instances for the asprilo framework.
- `encodings/` contains all of our encodings for the plan merger.
- `benchmark_tool/` contains our tool to generate benchmark instances.
