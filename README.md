# Plan Merging Project

## About
This is a student project at the University of Potsdam which deals with the the declarative programming language ASP (Answer Set Programming) and the [asprilo framework](https://potassco.org/asprilo/) by [potassco](https://potassco.org) where there are robots in a warehouse environment that need to fulfill their goals. For simplicity, we are solely focusing on the M-Domain in which it suffices when the robots reach the destination of an ordered product in a shelf. 
We aim to find a solution for intelligently merging plans of individual robots into one common plan for all robots to increase performance.

## File Structure
- `benchmarks/` contains all the M-domain benchmarks for the asprilo framework.
