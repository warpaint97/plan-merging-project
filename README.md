# Plan Merging Project

## About
This project deals with the the declarative programming language ASP (Answer Set Porgramming) and the asprilo framework by potassco where there are robots in a warehouse environment that need to fulfill their goals. For simplicity, we are solely focusing on the M-Domain in which it suffices when the robots reach the destination of an ordered product in a shelf. 
We aim to find a solution for intelligently merging plans of individual robots into one common plan for all robots to increase performance.
